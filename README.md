Weather is a simple SPA written with ClojureScript to show the weather for a few cities.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed to run in dev.

## Running in Dev

To start a web server for the application, in the root directory, run:

    lein run

Open a new terminal to the same root directory and run:

    lein figwheel

Then go to `localhost:3000`

## Testing

I wanted to finish this before the end of the week so, out of a concern for everyone's time, I did not add any tests.
